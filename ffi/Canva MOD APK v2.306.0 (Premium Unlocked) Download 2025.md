## Introduce about Canva
Design everything in a modern, minimalist style right on your mobile!

## What is Canva?
Canva is a photo and video editing application that is used by many people because of its unique features. Canva can be suitable for many different purposes of users, from designing posters, producing ad videos to other entertainment purposes such as creating funny and interesting photos. The most special thing is that most of the great features in the application are free products!

## Design everything with a single app
Our smartphones are already too crowded with all kinds of applications or games. Sometimes, we even forget the functionality of some applications “you haven’t opened it in a long time”. Knowing that, Canva has turned itself into a solution to this problem when it can solve many different tasks in the field of design.

Design images, edit them to be sharp, unique or edit movies, videos that are really impressive, a variety of templates available, these are all things that this application can do in a very light way. These seemingly annoying and time-consuming tasks have never been so easy, all in Canva. However, that doesn’t mean Canva is a mess. Every feature in the application is highly appreciated or in other words extremely thorough in every design stage.

## Community that loves design and is creative
Canva not only provides simple design tools, convenient creative environment, but also creates a Community of Design Lovers around the world. Currently, there is no other design application that focuses on many users and all share the same dynamics as Canva.

When you join Canva, you can share your design with everyone, and you can even have people edit it together. Conversely, you can also input other users’ designs if they allow it.

And yet, the creative works created, you can use a single function button with a quick operation to share right away on popular social networks such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter…

## Simple to use
“Rub! With so many features, it must be complicated to use.” That must be the thought of many people when first approaching Canva. It’s also true, but only half right. It is true that the application has a lot of diverse features, you even have to explore to know them all, but the features are easy to use. With more than 60000 templates including filters, effects, video editing options, from professional designers, you will easily do what you want just through the application’s built-in templates.

Let Canva know what your problem is, Canva will help you from A-Z at the support section. A fun entertainment photo, a wedding poster, a promotional video? It’s great if you already have your own ideas, but if not, don’t worry, Canva takes care of it. Just use the available suggestions to create a unique product. After using this app, I think the design profession is also easy (just kidding).

## Insert text into the image
After choosing a design you like, you can add the text or stickers you want to the image according to your preferences. With over 500 font options, users will even feel a little overwhelmed at the variety that the developers have invested in Canva. Choose beautiful photos to upload from your gallery, and use appropriate fonts to express how you feel. The end result is sure to be amazing!

## Making reports and presentations
Not only editing photos or videos, Canva also has another very remarkable feature that not many editing applications pay attention to, which is to support users to make presentations. I’m not joking, making presentations on photo editing apps is real.

Canva helps users create artful charts or graphs. They have many beautiful pre-made templates that you will want to try once. Those seemingly dry charts are now surprisingly alive through Canva’s great support tools. They can be static or dynamic depending on the user’s wishes. Enter data and select the type of spreadsheet and chart you want Canva to present, the application will automatically create a quality product thanks to those parameters.

## Nice interface
Admittedly, Canva has a really nice interface framework. The application clearly divides the features between Templates, Photo, Elements, Text, Music… So even with so many features, you can still distinguish them easily. Along with that, the modern colors in Canva always create a professional feeling for anyone who uses it.
